# RRT Item Set Editor
A command-line item set editor for US/Aus Pokemon Mystery Dungeon - Red Rescue Team. 

 - Converts item set data into readable, editable plain text lists
 - Converts text lists back into item set data before placing it in the ROM
 - Finds the item sets each floor of a dungeon uses

PLEASE read the instructions before use! Except for src, all of the files need to be downloaded: the executable must be in the same directory as DEFAULT_ITEMSET_LIST.txt and OFFSETS.txt.

Only supports the US/Australian release of RRT, but OFFSETS.txt can easily be edited for different localizations.
